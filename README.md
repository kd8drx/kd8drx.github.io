# Oh, look, a website
Most technical people have websites, if only as an exuse for having a custom email domain. Seeing as I'm not that interesting, there's not much here...but it's better than having nothing show up when you go to kilodelta.com?  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

# Theme

*Jekyll-Uno* - a minimal, responsive theme for Jekyll based on the [Uno](https://github.com/daleanthony/Uno) theme for Ghost.
